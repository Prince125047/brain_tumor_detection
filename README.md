# Hybrid Quantum-CNN-CBAM Model for Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains a custom deep learning model that integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)**, and a **Quantum Neural Network (QNN)** for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is built from scratch using TensorFlow and PennyLane, aiming to explore how quantum layers can enhance classical models.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

* **Source**: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)
* **Classes**: `glioma`, `meningioma`, `pituitary`, `no tumor`
* **Original Training Images**: 5,712
* **After Preprocessing & Augmentation**:

  * Training images: **11,424**
  * Testing images: **1,311**

The dataset was preprocessed (resizing, normalization) and augmented (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustments) using custom scripts provided in the `helper.py` file.

##  Model Overview

The proposed model combines classical and quantum layers in a custom architecture:

* **CNN Layers**: Feature extraction using multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling2D blocks.
* **CBAM Block**: Channel and spatial attention to enhance informative features.
* **Quantum Layer**: A PennyLane-based variational quantum circuit using AngleEmbedding and BasicEntanglerLayers.
* **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for final classification with softmax output.
